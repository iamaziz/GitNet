# GitHub Followers Network Graph Visualizer

This is a simple Streamlit app to visualize and explore the network of followers for a given GitHub user.
And explore the network using either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to fetch the followers of a user up to a specified depth.
The app uses the GitHub API to fetch the followers of a user and visualize the network using the `pyvis` library.

- Choose which `max_followers` to show. Maybe based on some criteria e.g. number of followers or activity ... etc.
